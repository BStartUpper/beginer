Hi GitHub
I came up with an interesting project yesterday and wanted to share it with you. 
The project is about buying rentals in different countries. It will be an ad platform where you can buy rentals. Payment will mostly be in cryptocurrency in the app itself, or when you meet the landlord. 
Earning has not thought of what will consist, but there are ideas: 
1) Percent of the transaction 
2) Paid promotion to the top of the listings.
 What do you think about it?
